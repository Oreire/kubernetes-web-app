## Deploying A Web Application on a Local Kubernetes Cluster
**Organizations seek efficient and cost-effective solutions for deploying and managing their web applications. 
Leveraging containerized applications within a Kubernetes environment offers a practical and scalable approach to achieving this goal. 
In this project, containers were deployed on a three-node Kubernetes cluster running on Docker Desktop, specifically designed for local development and testing. 
This setup allows developers to simulate production-like environments, streamline application management, and ensure seamless testing before deploying to multi-node or cloud-based Kubernetes clusters.
